# All UK public sector graduate schemes

Crowdsourced links to all UK public sector grad schemes and grad jobs - covering national and local government, the Civil Service, public bodies, healthcare, policing, and more.

Most schemes recruit only at specific times of the year. Many welcome careers changers who graduated some time ago, and some are also open to non-graduates. Many of the included organisations also offer entry-level roles and apprenticeships that can be suitable for graduates.
